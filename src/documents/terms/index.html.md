## Web Platform Contributor Agreement

I have read, understood and agree to be bound by the Web Platform Contributor Agreement.

This Contributor Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between You, the participating individual
or entity contributing content to the Web Platform Documentation Site (“Contributor”), and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, having an office at 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Room E19-750, Cambridge,
Massachusetts 02139-4307, USA (“MIT”); the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics, having
an office at 2004, Route des Lucioles, Sophia Antipolis, F-06410 Biot, France (“ERCIM”); Keio University, having
an office at 5322 Endo, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0882, Japan (“KEIO”) (collectively, “W3C Hosts”) on behalf of the
World Wide Web Consortium (“W3C”). This Agreement is effective as of the date Contributions are submitted by Contributor
(“the Effective Date”).

Contributor wishes to make available certain original works of authorship created or controlled by Contributor
including but not limited to documentation, reports, papers, instruction manuals, and other writings, code, software
tools, and databases (“Contribution”) for inclusion in the Web Platform Documentation Site ("Site").

W3C, in conjunction with the other Site Stewards, wishes to host some or all of that material on the Site under public
licenses that enable others, without payment of fees or royalties, to copy, modify, redistribute, and re-license such
material on similar terms,

Therefore, Contributor agrees to license and hereby licenses copyright in its Contributions to W3C Hosts MIT, ERCIM,
and KEIO under an unrestricted, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, world-wide, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferrable
license authorizing all uses, including reproduction, distribution, creation of derivative works, public display, public
performance, and public digital performance of sound recordings.

Contributor asserts that it has all rights necessary to so license its Contributions, and that the reproduction and publication
on the Site will not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party.

IN NO EVENT SHALL CONTRIBUTOR, MIT, ERCIM, OR KEIO, THEIR TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND ASSOCIATES
BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ECONOMIC DAMAGE OR INJURY TO PROPERTY AND LOST
PROFITS, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY SHALL BE ADVISED, SHALL HAVE OTHER REASON
TO KNOW, OR IN FACT SHALL KNOW OF THE POSSIBILITY.

By clicking on the "Create account" button at the end of this agreement, you are consenting to be bound by all of the
terms of this agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms of this agreement, do not click the "Create account" button,
and the account creation process will not continue.
