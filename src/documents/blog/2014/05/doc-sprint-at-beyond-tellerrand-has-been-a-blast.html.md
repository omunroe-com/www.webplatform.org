Last week another [Adobe-hosted Doc Sprint](http://lanyrd.com/2014/wpds-dusseldorf/) with 53 attendees out of 70 registered happened. According to our [Doc Sprint Dashboard](https://github.com/webplatform/DocSprintDashboard) the event resulted in over 800 edits to the wiki, got about 10 new contributors on board and smoothly transitioned over to the official warm-up-party for the famous [beyond tellerrand conference](http://2014.beyondtellerrand.com/side-events) in Düsseldorf, Germany.


## We had an awesome time!


While the original plan had been to run the event in a beach bar setting, lacking a beach bar we ended up under an old gas station from the 50s. Nevertheless, the deck chairs specially made for this event (no leftovers - sorry!), as well as a delicious barbeque and volumes of free beer (and other drinks) made a sunny and comfy location to spend all day. Some people even got sunburned; others sent us thanks for an unexpected tan. :) ﻿(And there are many more fun bits and stories to tell. Check out some of them over at the [Adobe Web Platform Team blog post](https://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2014/05/30/bbq-beer-web-platform-docs-ftw/) on the event.)

## Sun, fun, plus quite a bit got done


With the help of our community experts we split up the party into six focus groups as follows:

**The HTML Elements focus group** was led by [Paul Verbeek](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:Paulv) and, most of the time, consisted of 4 people: [Aaron Gustafson](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:AaronGustafson), [Horia Dragomir](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:Horia), [Michael Kühnel](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:Mkuehnel), and Paul, himself. The group documented a total of 33 elements and also made decisions on what to do with deprecated elements (= document them, stating it's deprecated and why, and write in the past tense). Find their [tracking sheet here](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday/html_elements).

**The JavaScript focus group**, led by [Rodney Rehm](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:Rodneyrehm), worked on the [Number object](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/javascript/Number). The group has put together a number of considerations and suggestions. Make sure to read through their [detailed work output here](https://gist.github.com/rodneyrehm/b39aa66351bbd3e2371c#file-feedback-md).

**The Responsive Images and SVG focus group**, led by [Anselm Hannemann](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:Anselm), focused on [img](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/html/elements/img), [picture](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/html/elements/picture), and their attributes, as well as a number of SVG elements and attributes. Read through their full results in the [WPDS-HTMLSVG-Group spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c1iMXbLln0x0Dmq4_xFEpoL3MdkcVhXfLQDEaHvkKgY/edit?pli=1#gid=0). The group also took notes on quite a bunch of bugs and issues, to be found [in this comment](https://gist.github.com/anselmh/a9ce8154f1ca3e41d3c0#comment-1230917) in [the focus groups work document](https://gist.github.com/anselmh/a9ce8154f1ca3e41d3c0).

**The JS API focus group** was led by [Francesco Iovine](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:Franciov), who actually spent most of the day giving kick start intro sessions to newcomers to WebPlatform.org, enabling them to immediately start contributing. Along with on-boarding new contributors, the JavaScript API focus group added examples to the [Web Storage API page](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/apis/web-storage). They also created and set up some missing API listing pages: [Ambient Light API](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/apis/ambient_light), [Device Orientation API](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/apis/device_orientation), [Screen Orientation API](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/apis/screen_orientation), and [Pointer Lock API](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/apis/pointer_lock).

**The "Do what you want" group**, led by [Hans Christian Reinl](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:Drublic), focussed on [general web concepts](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/concepts), [tutorials](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials) and [beginners docs](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/beginners). Six pages got revised and updated, and two new pages were created. Four pages received updates and still have open ends, two others definitely need more work - find all details at [the group work document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oNlctt17l9zjEg-2uQvzfDPcXDaR0PdWQWvJaz3yG6Q/edit#gid=0).

**The CSS focus group** led by [Christian "Schepp" Schaefer](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:Schepp) identified the following pages as being imported from MDN or MSDN, and reworked them according to the style guide: Selectors [:last-child](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/selectors/pseudo-classes/:last-child), [::before](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/selectors/pseudo-elements/::before), [::first-letter](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/selectors/pseudo-elements/::first-letter), [::first-line](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/selectors/pseudo-elements/::first-line); Functions [translate()](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/functions/translate()), [translateX()](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/functions/translateX()), [translateY()](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/functions/translateY()), [translate3d()](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/functions/translate3d()); Properties [zoom](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/properties/zoom), [left](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/properties/left), [right](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/properties/right), [object-fit](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/properties/object-fit), [transform](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/properties/transform), [font-variant](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/properties/font-variant), [text-shadow](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/properties/text-shadow); as well as the syntax page for [important!](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/syntax/important). The group also went through **every single CSS property** and **removed all prefixed example code**, just leaving the unprefixed CSS in there. Annoyingly they found a lot of CSS property pages that had an empty "CSS Object Model Property" table cell, or a wrong one, like "element.style.". A few of those got corrected. Also, a dabblet bug was found on [code.webplatform.org](http://code.webplatform.org) and fixed with the help of [Renoir Boulanger](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:Renoirb).


## Thanks to all the contributors and volunteers


This successful Doc Sprint would not have been possible without the help of our community experts and our lovely volunteers: [Pascal Szewczyk](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:Pepo), [Tomas Caspers](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:Tcaspers), [Kenneth Shinabery](http://twitter.com/KShinabery212), [Daniel Connerth](http://twitter.com/DanielConnerth), [Sven Wolfermann](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:Maddesigns), [Aaron Gustafson](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:AaronGustafson), [David Kirstein](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:Frozenice), and my partner in crime in organizing the event, [Marc Thiele](http://twitter.com/marcthiele). Thank you all.


## Want to run a Doc Sprint yourself?


[Doc Sprints](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Community/Community_Events) like this one are a fantastic opportunity to help push the web and its documentation forward. In the same time and place, you can meet and exchange with like-minded folks, learn, get inspired, and also have a nice BBQ and party. So why not run your own Doc Sprint? We created a document for you in case you'd like to create the next #WPDS: the [Doc-Sprint-in-a-Box](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Doc_Sprint).
