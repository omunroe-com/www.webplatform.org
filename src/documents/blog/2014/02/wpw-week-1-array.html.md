Here we are at Web Platform Wednesdays Week 1 for the JavaScript language reference! There's a reason why organizations and individuals have come together to document the web platform here. The content can be used and reused anywhere, without complex terms. What you contribute is for everyone's use. It's sort of documentation neutrality. So while this may appear to be just another JavaScript reference that we're embarking on, it really is different.

We've got the scaffolding down, thanks to Microsoft, but let's add some magic — that special something that comes from giving a gift, unconditionally.

We're starting with Array this week, focusing on the object, itself, the constructor, and those few properties that make Array a special object, such as length and isArray. When working with basic reference content, we have the opportunity to add some wise words (such as, unless there's a reason not to, create an array using literal notation). And let's up the ante with examples. What kinds of code helps you when you're learning a new feature? What did you wish you knew back way back when you were starting with JavaScript?

There's plenty to do, even if you're not a JavaScript expert: check the values against those in the spec, make sure all of the content from the MSDN page were imported, or find great blog posts and articles. Join us [this week](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday) as we get the facts down, provide clear information about the language, and share the magic. Check out the language elements and how the activities break down, then let us know what you want to do by emailing [the public list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webplatform/).
