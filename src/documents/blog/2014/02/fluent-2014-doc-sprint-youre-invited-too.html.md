A group of us working on WebPlatform Docs will be hosting a [Doc Sprint at Fluent 2014](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/webplatformorg-fluent2014-doc-sprint-tickets-9344681193), in San Francisco, on March 11th! O'Reilly has generously provided the facilities and experts through the [Fluent conference](http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014/public/schedule/detail/33084), but the doc sprint is open to the general public.

We receive content from various sources: companies, individual contributors, standards groups, and more. When we get the content, we review it, improve it, and add "that little something more." For example, right now, we're [concentrating on JavaScript language reference content](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday). A doc sprint is a period of concentrated effort by a number of people to improve that content, or really, any part of the site that you'd like to work on. It’s like a hackathon for documentation.

No experience is necessary! At a doc sprint, beginners can learn how to get started. We have some basic tasks that anyone can do with support. And we’ll be there to support all contributors. Folks with more experience can make great progress on deeper tasks. We’ll all collaborate on the site: extending it and building the content, itself. Bugs get fixed on the spot. We do usability testing. We eat and drink and… Well, doc sprints are great places to geek out, make new friends, and meet old ones. To get a sense of past doc sprints, check out [our previous posts](http://blog.webplatform.org/tag/doc-sprints/).

Just go to [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/webplatformorg-fluent2014-doc-sprint-tickets-9344681193) to sign up. We look forward to seeing you there!
