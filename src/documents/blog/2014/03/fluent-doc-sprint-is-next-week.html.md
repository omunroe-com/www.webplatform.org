We have [already blogged](http://blog.webplatform.org/2014/02/fluent-2014-doc-sprint-youre-invited-too/) about the upcoming [Doc Sprint at Fluent 2014](http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014/public/schedule/detail/33084), but I’ve compiled a few details, in case you have questions. You can also get a sense of what happens by reading about past doc sprints by checking out [our previous posts](http://blog.webplatform.org/tag/doc-sprints/).

First of all, the [Fluent conference](http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014) is hosting the Doc Sprint, providing the space & food. But you don’t have to go to the Fluent conference to attend the Doc Sprint. The Doc Sprint is open to the public. That means anyone can attend.

Yep, that means YOU are invited. So, what will happen when you come? The agenda will go something like this:

MORNING:



	
  * Welcome

	
  * Intro to WebPlatform.org docs

	
  * How to contribute

	
  * Doc Sprint!


LUNCH (yes, free food!):

	
  * Working, talking, sharing ideas


AFTERNOON:

	
  * Special guests Doug Schepers ([W3C](http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014/public/schedule/speaker/152197)), Jen Simmons ([Jen Simmons Design](http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014/public/schedule/speaker/119325)), and maybe a surprise or two…

	
  * More Doc Sprint!

	
  * Swag

	
  * Wrap-up


No experience is necessary. Seriously. That means you don’t have to be an expert, you need not know how to edit wiki-markup, or be familiar with any build tools. It’s a good idea to be there at the beginning, just so you get the information about getting started contributing. We’ll go over everything you need to know. Bear in mind that you can come for just part of the day, too.

We’ll be in Salon 5 at the [San Francisco Marriott Marquis](http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014/public/content/hotel)**, **780 Mission Street, San Francisco, CA.

You will need your own laptop and power (and power adaptors).

For any other questions, go ahead and email [the webplatform public list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webplatform/). And do sign up at [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/webplatformorg-fluent2014-doc-sprint-tickets-9344681193) to get the latest information and special treatment.

See you there!
