Since we launched on Monday, we’ve seen a number of different ways people are getting the message out about WPD: [blogs](http://paulirish.com/2012/why-im-so-excited-about-web-platform-docs/), [ news articles](http://www.webmonkey.com/2012/10/w3c-helps-you-build-a-better-web-with-web-platform-docs/), [tweets](https://twitter.com/search?q=webplatform), [press releases](http://www.w3.org/2012/10/webplatform.html), and more. Alex Komoroske, Peter Lubbers, and Scott Rowe—all with Google—have put together a [30 minute video](https://developers.google.com/live/shows/ahNzfmdvb2dsZS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzcg4LEgVFdmVudBiomqIEDA/) that’s a tour of our effort. This includes an overview of the site, a history of the content, instructions about getting started, possible future features, answers to viewers’ questions and much more. Take a look:



Have you used any unusual methods of telling friends and colleagues about WPD? Keep it legal, and keep it friendly, and let us know what weird ways you’re delivering the news about our site.
