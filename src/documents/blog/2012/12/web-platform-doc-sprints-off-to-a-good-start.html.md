On Saturday, November 3rd we held the first ever Web Platform Doc Sprint* at Adobe in San Francisco. It was a joint effort by [Adobe](http://html.adobe.com/), the [San Francisco HTML5 User](http://www.sfhtml5.org/) [Group](http://www.sfhtml5.org/), and [Google](https://developers.google.com/). We had a great and very productive day and onboarded 34 brand new members. The majority of the 50-60 attendees stayed the whole day, from 9 am until after 5 pm) and, from reading through the logs, I see that we made over 800 changes to the site that day. We had people working on tasks that ranged from simple to very complex. Some folks spent the whole day writing in-depth documentation while others dove into backend architecture tasks or created new prototypes of possible new site features.

A huge thanks to Adobe for not only hosting the event, but also providing breakfast, lunch, dinner, a full bar, and awesome swag (the exclusive WPD notepads)! Everybody went home with a new WPD t-shirt as well (they came in just in time). Good times all around. Pictures of the event can be found on the [SFHTML5 event page](http://www.sfhtml5.org/events/87609752/).

So now it's time to keep the momentum going! The next WebPlatform Doc Sprint is already planned for December 12th at Google office in Mountain View. Scott Rowe and I are organizing that one and we will have some really cool, exclusive swag items. You can sign up at [http://goo.gl/iBkiu](http://goo.gl/iBkiu). We hope you'll join us.

* A doc sprint is a period of concentrated effort by a number of people to improve documentation.
