We are overwhelmed by all the interest and active participation Web Platform Docs has garnered so far. We've had many organizations ask about becoming a steward in order to help make sure the site lives up to its potential.

We're pleased to announce today that [Intel](http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/intel) is the first company to sign on as a new steward since the initial alpha announcement.

Intel has demonstrated their long-standing commitment to standards, open source software projects, and education, and has been a W3C member for many years. We are excited that they are extending their commitment as a Web Platform Docs steward.

People who use Web Platform Docs want to know how to build web apps that perform well across devices and architectures. Intel brings to the table a lot of experience with different systems, and has indicated their plans to contribute to our documentation.

As we continue to improve the site, refine our infrastructure and build up content in preparation for our formal launch, we anticipate many more stewards will sign on, and we are grateful that Intel is the first of these. We actively invite other organizations to consider joining [Intel](http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/intel), along with [Adobe](http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/adobe), [Apple](http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/), [Facebook](http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/facebook), [Google](http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/google), [HP](http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/hp), [Microsoft](http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/microsoft), [Mozilla](http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/mozilla), [Nokia](http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/nokia), and [Opera](http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/opera), as a steward of WebPlatform.org. You can find out more on our [stewards page](http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/).

Welcome, Intel, and thank you for your support!


**Update:** Intel has announced their own developer site, the [Intel® HTML5 Zone](http://software.intel.com/html5). Over the coming months, we will work with Intel to pool our resources to best effect for Web Platform Docs, and for Web developers. We are very excited about this relationship.
