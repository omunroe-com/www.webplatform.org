Many of you have asked for live code examples that allow you to tweak the code and observe what happens. We agree that a feature like this would be of huge educational value and are actively working on providing it.

We plan to use a hosted (and probably customized) version of [dabblet](http://dabblet.com/), an [open source project](https://github.com/LeaVerou/dabblet) built by [yours truly](http://lea.verou.me/). We decided to use dabblet because it's a mature project that has been extensively tested in the community by a couple thousand users every day for almost a year, and because of its unique features, such as its [CSS value previewers](http://dabblet.com/gist/1441328).

Before we integrate dabblet with WPD, we will need to make a few changes to it and add some features, most of which will be pushed to the [dabblet.com](http://dabblet.com/) website as well. The most significant of these changes is adding JavaScript integration, a long overdue feature. Also, we'll have to fix a few bugs, improve cross-browser support, and strengthen security.

This work will take some time, but we are confident that when it’s out you will agree with us that it was absolutely worth it.
