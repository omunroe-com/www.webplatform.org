Last week we decided to take a small break to give everyone a rest and let you enjoy the holidays, so this week we are coming back in full force to tackle the next batch of CSS properties. This week, we will be focusing on **layout based properties**, which are fundamentally the foundation properties of all websites.

These properties that we will be covering, range from **padding** and **size** to **positioning** properties such as **top**, **left**, **right**, **bottom** and **float**. If you aren't too familiar with these properties, here are some great reference materials on some of the CSS properties.

**Position**

**Padding**



	
  * [A comprehensive post on Padding](http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/padding/)


**Float**



	
  * [CSS Floats 101](http://alistapart.com/article/css-floats-101)

	
  * [CSS Float Theory: Things you should know](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2007/05/01/css-float-theory-things-you-should-know/)


To view all the properties that we will be covering this week, head on over to the [Web Platform Wednesday page](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday#10_July_2013) and see where you can help. If you find any properties that you want to help contribute to, have any questions or even not sure, come and chat with the co-ordinators in the [#webplatform IRC Channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=webplatform) or via email on the [mailing list](mailto:public-webplatform@w3.org), as there is always someone who will be happy to help.

Until next week, happy documenting!
