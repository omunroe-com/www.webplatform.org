I thought I'd share some thoughts this week on how we are working towards making web standards documentation rock more here at WebPlatform.org! We knew it would be challenging to deal with this much content, especially as we are mostly volunteers with only a finite amount of time available to work on the project. We've already achieved much, working towards our goal of making WebPlatform.org _the_ definitive client-side web technology documentation site, but there is still much more to do. This is why we opened it up to the wider community as an alpha.

The plan has always been to include the public as early as possible. The web does, after all, belong to all of us. To facilitate _getting_ things done, we have a number of communication means at our disposal. We have a number of [discussion methods](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:discuss) available including IRC and a mailing list. These are mostly used for general communication, such as announcing in-person Doc Sprints, soliciting feedback and discussing current and future work. For focusing on particular tasks, we:



	
  * Identify specific tasks to work on. To make the work more manageable, we have started to split it into manageable chunks and we work on each item in turn.

	
  * Discuss these tasks via our regular communication means, and also have more involved discussions at our [regular weekly meetings](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Meetings), simultaneously held on teleconference and IRC.

	
  * Record task priority lists and who is working on each task, at our [beta requirements page](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Beta_Requirements).

	
  * Create detailed task plans to outline how the work will be done, with subtasks, and people assigned to complete them.

	
  * Get on with the tasks!

	
  * Speed up task progress with intensive bursts of work at [Doc Sprint events](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Community/Community_Events).




## Current priorities


At the moment, the main topics we are focusing on are [CSS properties](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Tasks/CSS_Property_Milestone) and [JavaScript APIs](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/WPD:Proposals/api_docs). Our plan is to perfect the topic pages for these two major areas over the next two to three months. This is where you come in! If you are knowledgeable and passionate about these areas, please [get in touch with us](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/TEST:discuss) to find out how best to contribute. If you don't wish to contribute to either of these focus areas, and wish to work on something else instead, get in touch anyway, as we will be able to find something for you to do.

The next Doc Sprint we have coming up is in [Berlin, Germany](http://web-platform-doc-sprint-berlin.eventbrite.com/#), this week — we expect to make a lot of progress on our priority tasks there!
