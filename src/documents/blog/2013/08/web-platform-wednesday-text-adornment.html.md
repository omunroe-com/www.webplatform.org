Why, oh why, would you want to use text without adornment on a webpage? That’s so 1990’s. This week we focus our Web Platform Wednesday work on some more CSS properties that take plain text and make it stand out in a crowd. We’ve selected a little over a dozen CSS properties from the [CSS3 Text](http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-text-20030514/), the [CSS Exclusions Module Level 1](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-exclusions/), and the [CSS Line Layout Module Level 3](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-inline/) specifications, and we’re looking for volunteers to create, edit, and review the reference content for each of them on Webplatform Docs.

Sure, this is just a subset of what you can do with text using CSS, but I’d like to think that these properties enable the tasteful accessorizing of text, adding just the right touch to your work (without going so far as to be tacky, a la the [CSS WG’s April fool’s joke from 2012](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2012Apr/att-0000/css3-images)).

And so this is where you come in. You’re unique; you have that certain je ne sais quoi about you. Bring that panache, that élan, and use it to help document the web. And as you can see, a number of the properties are either obsolete or unsupported and require minimal documentation, so this week's group is fun _**and** _easy!

Let one of the coordinators know which CSS properties you are interested in documenting. Make sure you have a user account for Webplatform Docs. And then follow the guidelines on the [Web Platform Wednesday page](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday#Tasks). There are lots of people to help, should you run into any snags. And, voila, you’re documenting the web!


## What is Web Platform Wednesday?


There are many contributors doing work throughout Webplatform Docs. Some are working on infrastructure, some on community, some in content, and some lurking in the corners, waiting for the perfect opportunity. Web Platform Wednesday is a way to find a volunteer opportunity for those looking to add some value to the project. In the weekly meetings, we choose areas of priority for the project and then actively solicit help. Right now, we’re working on completing a pass on our CSS property docs. Join in. Bienvenue!
