Sound the alphorns! This week we salute our friends at the doc sprint in Zurich, Switzerland and anticipate a lot of great work on the CSS properties. If you can't make it to Zurich, you can at least be with the doc sprinters in spirit as they and you dip into this week's cheesy (or chocolately) pot of CSS properties.

Indeed there is a veritable Matterhorn of left-over properties that we need to revisit from previous weeks. So, don your crampons, ascend to the [Web Platform Wednesday page](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday#10_July_2013) and pick a route, er, property. Your coordinators, or Peters Taugwalder, will be ready to guide you. And I think I've beaten the mountain climbing analogy sufficiently into the pack ice.

You don't have to be a genius like Albert Einstein (aw, come on, you saw that coming) nor a visionary like Albert Hofmann (not that one, though, I bet), but being a good sport like (wait for it) Roger Federer (for the win!) certainly helps.

If you have any questions or are not sure where to start, come and chat with the coordinators in the [#webplatform IRC Channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=webplatform) or via email on the [mailing list](mailto:public-webplatform@w3.org), as there is always a volunteer who will be happy to help, like (one more for the road) the Red Cross!
