Ding-ding! This week, we finish up with the first round of editing and adding samples to CSS properties. We'll need to go back and pick up properties that weren't completed or were recently added. But this is a great week to pick up a random property and add some quality to it. Position, clip, visibility, and other properties are waiting for basic facts, useful explanations, examples, and links to great articles.

So, head on over to the [Web Platform Wednesday page](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday#10_July_2013) and see where you can help. If you find any properties that you want to help contribute to, have any questions or even are not sure where to start, come and chat with the coordinators in the [#webplatform IRC Channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=webplatform) or via email on the [mailing list](mailto:public-webplatform@w3.org), as there is always someone who will be happy to help.
