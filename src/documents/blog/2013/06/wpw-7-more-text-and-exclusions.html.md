This week, we continue to work on text properties, but we're adding some interesting properties. So if you know how to break out an experimental browser, and test the limits of features such as CSS Exclusions and Shapes, this is the week for you to jump in! And just in time for the latest [Editor's Draft](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-shapes/). If you have an experimental browser available, such as [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html) or [WebKit Nightly](http://nightly.webkit.org/), you can view demos such as [The Raven](http://adobe.github.io/web-platform/samples/css-exclusions/nevermore/index.html) and create your own.

There are some great explanations of CSS Exclusions out there, such as Hans Muller's [Growing and Shrinking Polygons: Round One](http://hansmuller-webkit.blogspot.com/2013/04/growing-and-shrinking-polygons-round-one.html) and Bem Jones-Bey's [Freeing the Floats of the Future From the Tyranny of the Rectangle](http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2013/03/27/freeing-the-floats-of-the-future-from-the-tyranny-of-the-rectangle/).

But also, if you happen to be going to the [Seattle Doc Sprint](http://blog.webplatform.org/2013/06/1st-seattle-doc-sprint/) this Saturday, June 22, you can ask questions of Alan Stearns, one of the editors of the [CSS Exclusions](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-exclusions/) and [CSS Shapes](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-shapes/) specs. He'll be there, along with other special guests.

Not in Seattle this weekend? No problem. Come chat with us on the [#webplatform IRC Channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=webplatform) or on our [public-webplatform@w3.org email list](mailto:public-webplatform@w3.org?subject=(WPW)). However you join, do join Web Platform Wednesday [this week](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday) as we continue to provide foundational and experimental content for our community.
