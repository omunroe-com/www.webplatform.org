[Webplatform.org](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Main_Page) continues to grow in all facets: breadth of content, accuracy, community health, and site usefulness. It’s a testament to the vibrancy of our community that we now have almost twenty thousand registered users! And though we are making great progress in building our “community-driven site that aims to become a comprehensive and authoritative source for web developer documentation,” there are still plenty of opportunities to make significant contributions.

<!-- more -->

One of the most important ways we advance our goals is through our Doc Sprints. We’ve organized successful doc sprints in cities in the US and Europe, and at each one, we’ve realized a number of goals:



	
  * People new to Webplatform learn how to get started as contributors.

	
  * Experienced contributors dive in to the content and make rapid progress.

	
  * Face-to-face contact builds relationships and networks.

	
  * Great ideas germinate and grow through collaboration.

	
  * Bugs get fixed on the spot.

	
  * Mini projects spring up and get prototyped.


But mostly, these have provided a time to get together and geek out. So, come geek out!


## Welcome to Seattle!


Come join us at the Microsoft offices in South Lake Union for the first doc sprint held in the Emerald City. The Internet Explorer Developer Relations Team is hosting a Doc Sprint in Seattle on June 22, 2013. We’ll work on improving CSS properties (and possibly JavaScript topics), but there are opportunities to work on other areas of the documentation. There’s no special expertise needed. Everyone is welcome. We’ll have people there to help walk you through all the steps. All you need bring is desire and your own computer. Meet web developers from around the Puget Sound region. Mingle with colleagues from other companies. There will be free food, t-shirts, and prizes! We’ll have a couple of presentations about the importance of the project. There’ll even be a special guest appearance by Doug Schepers, Developer Relations Lead of the W3C. We’ll provide snacks, meals & drinks, and there will be some cool gifts—even a [Surface Pro](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/surface-with-windows-8-pro/) for one lucky winner!
