It is that time of week again, time for Web Platform Wednesday! And this week's theme is Text. This will see us focus on continuing to document the vast amount of CSS properties available for Text. Ranging from text **sizing**, to **styling**, **alignment** and even **kerning**.

Not sure of how you can help contribute? We have a list of various tasks that can be done, from smaller, quick tasks such as adding some basic facts for a property to writing explanatory notes and examples. Find out all about these tasks and more on our [Web Platform Wednesday page](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday#Tasks) or if you have any questions or even ideas, come chat on [#webplatform IRC Channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=webplatform) or on our [public-webplatform@w3.org email list](mailto:public-webplatform@w3.org?subject=(WW)).

So come and join us this week and help document the web, making styling text that much better and easier to learn about.

PS: If you haven't already seen it, we have a new [video tutorial](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday#Video_Tutorial) on how to get started on contributing and editing CSS properties.
