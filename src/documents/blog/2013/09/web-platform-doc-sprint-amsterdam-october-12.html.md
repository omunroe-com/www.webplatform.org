Amsterdam, if reluctantly, is arguably one of the world's premiere party towns. But the infamous Dutch modesty prevents the city from ascending (or descending) to the ranks of Rio De Janeiro, Bangkok, New Orleans, or Goa, to name a few. No, the Dutch would redirect us to take stock of their fine art, their rich cultural history, and their sober, reliable industry before casting them in with the lot of debauched metropolises where the party is not only the thing, it's the only thing.




We could never get away with a doc-sprint-slash-birthday-party in a town the likes of Mykonos or Cabo San Lucas. Even Las Vegas or Monte Carlo might be pushing it.  No, for the first birthday celebration of Web Platform Docs we needed a place that can get down to business as well as get down and boogie.




So, last February in Berlin (another modest party stronghold and doc sprint site), when our man in the Netherlands, [Paul Verbeek](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/User:Paulv), offered to host a doc sprint to follow the [Fronteers](http://fronteers.nl/congres/2013) conference in October, the birth month of Web Platform Docs, we were wildly enthusiastic - well, as wildly enthusiastic as one may properly be in Northern Europe.




This will be our third European doc sprint as well as our first birthday. There will be cake! We'll celebrate the work we've done this year, which is quite a lot when you stand back and look at it, and rededicate ourselves to building the best technical documentation for the web community.

If you're new to the web community or new to Web Platform Docs, we'll help you get started with contributing to the documentation. This is a great way to learn about web development and meet other web professionals.

If you're an old pro on the web, but new to Web Platform Docs, you'll easily get up to speed and start contributing your expertise to the benefit of the whole community.

If you're coming to Amsterdam for the [Fronteers](http://fronteers.nl/congres/2013) conference, you can stay an extra day and drop by the doc sprint for a few hours or the whole day.

If you're already a member of WebPlatform.org, you can help the newbies or just jump right in and start contributing.

We'll have specific areas of content for you to work on, and if you have other content that you want to contribute or other projects that you want to work on, you're certainly welcome to do that, too.

Paul has set us up to work in [The Hub](http://amsterdam.impacthub.net/), the perfect collaboration and community workspace, right in the heart of the Jordaan neighborhood of central Amsterdam. There will be food and drink provided. Of course, there will be cake. We'll have a raffle and prizes for outstanding efforts, as well as plenty of t-shirts, stickers, and other swag.




We hope to see many of you who have attended other European doc sprints. Julee from Adobe and I (Scott from Google) have booked our flights. Paul Irish said he would try to be there - if he survives the post-Fronteers party. (I should mention here that past doc sprints have proven to be an excellent diversion whilst one is recovering from a night's libations, or even just couple of days at a conference.)

This is an excellent opportunity to connect with other web professionals, collaborate on ideas and problems, do some great documentation, and celebrate!  We hope to see you there!




Oh, did I mention there will be cake?
