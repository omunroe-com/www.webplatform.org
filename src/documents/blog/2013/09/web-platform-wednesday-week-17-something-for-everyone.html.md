[Last week](http://blog.webplatform.org/2013/08/web-platform-wednesday-week-16-left-over-fondue/) saw our fondue pot of left over properties go down well as we started recapping, with the help of the [Switzerland Doc Sprint](http://blog.webplatform.org/2013/09/switzerland-doc-sprint-sets-some-new-records/).

This week, we thought we would ease into our next Web Platform Wednesday as everyone starts to get back into the swing of things. As we start to revise all the hard work that everyone has put into the previous weeks, getting all the CSS properties documented, we thought we would continue to work on and cover any and all properties that may have been missed along the way. This can range from working with layout and grid properties to putting your typographer's hat on and immersing into the world of CSS text properties.

No matter what your strength is, or the extent of your knowledge, this week's [Web Platform Wednesday](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/Meta:web_platform_wednesday#2013_Sep_4) has a little something for everyone. If you are still not sure if there is something for you, then head on over to the [#webplatform IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=webplatform) channel and chat with this great community or even send us an email on our [mailing list](mailto:public-webplatform@w3.org) as there will always be someone happy to help.

From everyone on the Web Platform team, happy documenting the web.
