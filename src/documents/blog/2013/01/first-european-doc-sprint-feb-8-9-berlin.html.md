People all over the web are contributing great ideas and tools, and the momentum for viable, open, global web standards is growing every day. Unfortunately disparate, inconsistent, and outdated information still needs to be collected and perfected in one place we all can rely on.

[WebPlatform.org](http://webplatform.org) is an idea that is coming into being through corporate sponsors, [open web stewards](http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/), and — most importantly — individuals who are taking charge and creating a workspace for quality documentation. Everyday people volunteer their ideas and their time and build great content in a single place. **But we still have a lot to do.**

One way we get folks inspired is through [our Doc Sprints](http://blog.webplatform.org/tag/doc-sprints/). These concentrated days of documentation work allow people to get started, really get stuck in, and make rapid progress. They also provide direct face-to-face contact between community members who previously only chatted online. Doc Sprints are places with lots of great ideas flying around. Bugs get addressed on the spot. Mini projects spring up and get prototyped and utilized right away. But mostly, it's a time to gather together individuals who care about the web to work towards common goals.

So without further ado ... it is a privilege to announce that [the very first European Doc Sprint is taking place](http://web-platform-doc-sprint-berlin.eventbrite.com/), in Berlin, on February 8-9, hosted by Adobe.

The main focus will be on improving WebPlatform.org content, but in addition we also want to **put weight on encouraging web community managers to run their own Doc Sprints**. If you are a web community manager and would like to organize a Web Platform Doc Sprint of your own, we would love you to join us in Berlin so we can give you the information you need to get started! Make sure you select the appropriate ticket category on registration so we can have your special Doc Sprint Starter Kit prepared for you.

**Join us in Berlin.** And if you can't be there in person, please join us on the [Freenode IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/) channel #webplatform. We are looking forward to seeing you at the first ever European Doc Sprint!
