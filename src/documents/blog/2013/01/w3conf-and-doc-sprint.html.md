In just a month W3C and Adobe are teaming up with other partners to host a developer conference and a Web Platform Doc Sprint.

**[W3Conf](http://www.w3.org/conf/)**, W3C's conference for developers and designers, is coming up on February 21-22 at the Regency Ballroom in San Francisco. This is not just another conference on web development, but a showcase on the most pragmatic aspects of web standards, stuff you can use today. The opening session, delivered by Mozilla's **Janet Swisher** and W3C's **Doug Schepers**, will feature Web Platform Docs and community involvement. Other speakers who have contributed to WebPlatform.org include **CJ Gammon** on digital books, **Lea Verou** on CSS secrets, and **Alexis Deveria** on cutting-edge web features, along with many other great presentations. See the [full list of speakers and talks](http://www.w3.org/conf/#schedule) on the W3Conf site. The closing keynote on CSS layout is by **Eric Meyer**, and a twist on the classic browser panel will give voice to an authoring tool vendor and a [developer and designer from the audience](http://www.w3.org/QA/2013/01/join_us_at_w3conf.html) (maybe you!) to represent the view from the trenches.

The accompanying [**Doc Sprint**](http://docsprint.eventbrite.com/) to bolster the content on Web Platform Docs will be held the day after the conference, Saturday February 23rd, at the Adobe office. This is a free all-day event where you can meet the developers behind WebPlatform.org, and learn how you can help create content on Web Platform Docs, or even take the lead in areas that you're an expert on. Contributing to Web Platform Docs is a great way to let your light shine.
